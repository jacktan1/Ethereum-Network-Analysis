# Ethereum Network Analysis

## Description
Analyze Ethereum's blockchain network via Python implementation of 
[Ethereumâ€™s peer-to-peer node discovery protocols](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p).
Allows for continuous discovery of new nodes and monitoring of existing ones.

## Use Cases
- Locate miner nodes by profiling new block arrival latencies 
and mempool data across nodes. Ensure transactions are submitted to miners without
paying MEV-Relay fees.
- Compare performance of nodes in a network, applicable to blockchain research
and tracking.

## Sample Usage
- [**Adding nodes to routing table**](https://github.com/jacktan1/Ethereum-Network-Analysis/blob/master/example.ipynb)
